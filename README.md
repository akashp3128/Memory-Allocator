# Memory Allocator

This is a simple implementation of a memory allocator in C, providing `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc` functions. The implementation uses a linked list to keep track of allocated memory blocks.

## Features

- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`.
- Thread-safe operations using a global mutex.
